# gml-cli
 Because why not?

Powered by GMLspeak and [Catspeak](https://github.com/katsaii/catspeak-lang)<br>
Inspired by [gml-cli js version](https://github.com/christopherwk210/gml-cli)

Usage:
`gml-cli.exe -s file-goes-here` or `gml-cli.exe -script file-goes-here`

Sandbox is disabled, so should be good for making quick lil GML script test cases or whatever!

# Why?
I thought it'd be a fun idea lol

# What does it support?
I can tell you what it doesn't support! As the list for that is much shorter than what it does.
- Multiline strings
- Template strings
- Static variables 
- Constructor
- "global function" syntax `function func() {}`
- try/catch/finally
- enums
- macros
- exit keyword
- delete keyword (ok it's technically supported but it has bugs so I've disabled it for now)
